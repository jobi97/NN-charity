# NN-charity
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
For this analysis, we were asked to use unsupervised deep learning neural networks with Tensorflow to perform analysis of the provided dataset of charity donations.  The idea was to measure if the donations had an impact or not.  This was done by first fixing our data to remove uneeded columns, prepping the data for the neural network to read, compiling/training/evaluating the NN model, and optimizing the model.
